which is avilable at [Jovian.ml](https://www.jovian.ml/) and at freeCodeCamp.org [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo_fUOk-IKk&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbm3T2Eq1_KgloC7ogdXxdRa) channel.

The course instructor was [Aakash](https://github.com/aakashns) who is the co-founder and CEO of [Jovian.ml](https://www.jovian.ml/).

## Overview

“Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs” is an online course intended to provide a codingfirst
introduction to deep learning using the PyTorch framework. The course takes a hands-on
coding-focused approach and will be taught using live interactive Jupyter notebooks, allowing
students to follow along and experiment. Theoretical concepts will be explained in simple
terms using code. Students will receive weekly assignments, work on a project with real-world
datasets and participate in a private data science competition to test their skills. Upon
successful completion of the course, students will receive a certificate of completion.

## Certification

By the end of the 60 hours course a [certificate](https://jovian.ml/certificate/MFQWCNRQGY) was issued by [Jovian.ml](https://www.jovian.ml/) and [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
